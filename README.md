# obs_sort_files_by_date
Script that sort OBS recorded files into folders named by date

ATTENTION Only works in Python 3.6.x

You have to edit the move_files_to_folder.py file in order to select the origin and destination folder for the files

Then add the "explorer_select_last_recording.py" file to the OBS Scripts , and select the origin folder in the properties panel 



(this script can be improved joinig the .py together and adding a checkbox option to the properties panel, that let you sort files by date into folders.)
